# Wandering Warriors

Please use this README to document your team's project. Make sure to include a general description, information on how to set-up and run your project, and anything else you think may be interesting for a README. The README is usually the first document people read when they visit a project on GitHub, so it's a good idea to make it appealing.

## Installation

We use `pipenv` as a virtual environment wrapper, so to install kivy, just run `pipenv install`.

## Development Installation

There are a couple other dependencies for development: `flake8` and `pre-commit`. Just run `pipenv install --dev` to install these.

If you want your code scanned by `flake8` every time you commit, just run `pipenv run pre-commit install` once.
A fair warning for those using pre-commit hooks: your next commit will take a while due to installing flake8's hook. After that, the commits do not take any time at all.
